## Installation

Copy down the entire repository to a local folder and run "npm install". All the dependencies will be installed. You will also want to edit the MySQL logon credentials in the .env file.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
